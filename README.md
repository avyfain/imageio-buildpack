Heroku buildpack: ImageIO Binaries
=================================

This is a [Heroku buildpack](http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/buildpacks) for vendoring [ImageIO](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/imageio) binaries into your project. It is heavily based on [peterkeen's heroku-buildpack-vendorbinaries](https://github.com/peterkeen/heroku-buildpack-vendorbinaries)
